# Discord Ticket Bot
 
 This bot allows server members to create support tickets with a reason, and admins can manage the tickets efficiently. Admins can also generate a transcript of the ticket for record-keeping.

## Features:
**1. Create Tickets:** Users can create a ticket with a specified reason, which will be sent to the admins for review.

**2. Ticket Transcripts:** Admins can take a transcript of the ticket for documentation purposes.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

 - Node.js
 - PM2 (Process Manager)

### Installation
**1. Clone the repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the repository directory.

**2. Rename the example environment file: Rename `example.env` to `.env`.**

**3. Add your Discord bot token and other necessary information to the `.env` file:**
```
TOKEN = your_discord_bot_token
ClientID = your_admin_channel_id
GuildID = your_guild_id
```
